# <dist/browser> is the browser client as the wasm build leaves it: index.html and

#   Reference_WebClientEngine.zip   the client's own code, ~18 MB, published as a
#                                   release asset of this repository
#   Reference_WebClientData.zip     the game's data, ~1.75 GB, published on MEGA
#                                   because it is not ours to redistribute
#
# and, printed at the end, the exact lines artifacts.json needs. Nothing here
# uploads anything: publishing is a decision, and it is made by a person.
#
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#  WHY THE ENGINE'S CONTENTS ARE A LIST AND NOT A PATTERN
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# The first engine archive was packed by hand, and it was packed one file short:
# index.dev, the pack list, which webfs.js writes to /pack/index.dev for
# InitPacks to read. Nothing noticed. The archive unpacked cleanly, every check
# passed, /play/ served a page -- and the client stopped at "starting…" on a
# 404 that no log on the server called an error, because a 404 IS what the
# server should say about a file nobody installed.
#
# So the engine's contents are written out below, one line each. A file that is
# missing stops the run and names itself; a file that is present and NOT listed
# is reported too, because that is how the next index.dev would announce itself.
# A glob would have shipped whatever happened to be in the directory, which is
# how the bug happened in the first place.
#
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#  WHY index.dev TRAVELS WITH THE ENGINE AND NOT WITH THE DATA
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# It describes the data -- it is the list of packs in the corpus -- so on the
# face of it it belongs in the data archive. It ships with the engine anyway,
# for a practical reason and a correct one:
#
#   practical  it is 1.8 KB. Putting it in the data archive means re-uploading
#              1.75 GB to MEGA to fix a typo in it.
#   correct    artifacts.json already pins the pairing: engine_requires_data
#              names the data version an engine was built against, and
#              fetch-web-client.sh refuses a mismatch. An engine that carries
#              the pack list of the corpus it was built against is exactly what
#              that field already promises.
#
# Change the corpus and you publish a new data version AND a new engine that
# names it. That was true before this file existed.
