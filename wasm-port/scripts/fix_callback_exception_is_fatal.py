"""A Python exception in a callback must be a log line, not the end of the client.

THE SECOND FAULT, and the more serious of the two. Measured:

    PCF: callable, tp_call=0x183d args=0xaa77578 -- calling now
    PCF: call returned 0x0              <- the method raised, normally
    Uncaught RuntimeError: null function

The call itself completes and returns NULL, which is CPython's ordinary way of
saying "an exception is set". What kills the client is what happens NEXT, in
the branch that is supposed to REPORT it:

    if (g_pkExceptionSender) g_pkExceptionSender->Clear();
    PyErr_Print();
    if (g_pkExceptionSender) g_pkExceptionSender->Send();

One of those three goes through a table slot that holds nothing. So any script
error anywhere in the UI -- a typo in a quest window, a None where a string was
expected -- takes the whole client down instead of printing a traceback. That
is a mine under every future change to the Python side, and it is why a
harmless SetName(None) turned into an unplayable character.

WHAT THIS DOES

Reads the exception out with PyErr_Fetch, turns it into text, and logs it. The
old reporting path is left in place but is no longer reached with a live
exception: it cannot fire, so it cannot trap. The client carries on with the
callback having failed, which is what the caller already expects -- every one
of them checks the bool and does nothing more than skip.

It is also the diagnostic that was missing: the log line names the exception
type, its message and the method it came from, so the NEXT script fault is
readable instead of fatal.

PyErr_Fetch/NormalizeException/Str are pure C API calls on objects CPython has
just created; none of them route through the emscripten call trampoline, which
is what the broken path appears to do.

Idempotent. Run against /opt/m2wasm; a second run reports `already patched'.
