"""High Risk -- a permanently switchable free-PvP mode, offered at level 15.

WHAT THE MODE IS

A character that has reached level 15 may choose High Risk. After that it is
free game: anybody may attack and kill it, its own empire included, and nobody
is punished for doing so. In exchange it earns 50% more experience and finds
50% more drops, and when it dies it drops items the way a Cruel character does
-- the bottom band of the stock alignment table, bags and worn equipment alike,
with the stock quantities and the stock protections. No Risk is the ordinary
game and is what a character has until it says otherwise. Either choice can be
reversed at any time by talking to a Guardian or a City Guard.

WHY IT IS SPLIT THE WAY IT IS

The choice lives in a quest flag written by a new quest file, `high_risk.quest'.
What the flag MEANS is in the game core. That split is not a preference, it is
the only shape this source allows, and the three reasons are worth writing down
because each of them was the obvious approach first:

  * THE DROP-ON-DEATH RULE CANNOT BE A QUEST. There is no `dead' event in this
    quest engine -- the parser knows click, kill, timer, levelup, login, logout,
    button, info, chat, in, out, use, server_timer, enter, leave, letter, take,
    target, party_kill, unmount, pick, sig_use and item_informer, and nothing
    else (questmanager.cpp, CQuestManager::Initialize). Worse, qc does not
    validate event names at all, so `when dead begin ... end' compiles cleanly
    and is then never called: a silent no-op that looks exactly like working
    code.

  * THE BONUSES CANNOT BE AFFECTS. affect.add() ignores which affect type you
    would like and always uses AFFECT_QUEST_START_IDX -- 1000 -- keying only the
    apply within it (questlua_affect.cpp). affect.get_apply_on() can only ask
    about a type, not about a type and an apply. The server-wide movement-speed
    quest already owns type 1000 and decides whether to re-apply itself by
    asking `affect.get_apply_on(1000) == nil'; a second quest affect would
    answer that question wrongly and speed_boost.quest would stop re-applying
    the movement bonus after every death. The two would fight, and the
    movement bonus would lose.

  * POINT_MALL_ITEMBONUS IS NOT WIRED TO ANYTHING. It is the obvious lever for
    "+50% drop" and the item mall's own point type, but the two lines in
    ITEM_MANAGER::GetDropPct that would read it are commented out in this
    source. Setting it would raise a number in the character window and change
    no drop at all. POINT_MALL_EXPBONUS, its neighbour, IS wired up -- but
    granting it means a PointChange that persists in the player row, which is a
    worse thing to leave behind than a flag.

WHAT CARRIES THE PvP HALF -- AND THE VISIBILITY, FOR FREE

A High Risk character wears the killer flag permanently, and that one fact does
almost everything the specification asks for, using only stock code:

  * CPVPManager::CanAttack returns true the moment it sees
    `pkVictim->IsKillerMode()', before empire, guild or PK mode are consulted.
    So a High Risk character is attackable by anyone, including its own empire.
    pvp.cpp is not touched at all.
  * CHARACTER::Dead skips the attacker's alignment penalty when the victim was
    a killer, so killing a High Risk character costs the killer nothing. Again
    stock, again untouched.
  * The flag travels to every nearby client in the character packet's
    bStateFlag (ADD_CHARACTER_STATE_KILLER, set in m_bAddChrState and sent from
    char.cpp), so a High Risk character is DRAWN the way a player-killer is
    drawn -- to itself and to everyone around it. That is the answer to "make
    it evident to the player": it is the one marker in this protocol that the
    server can turn on unilaterally and that everybody can see, and it means
    exactly the right thing.

Two stock safety nets survive untouched and are worth knowing about: a victim
in PK_MODE_PROTECT on its own empire's map is still protected, which keeps
under-15s and GMs out of this entirely, and players cannot select PROTECT
themselves (do_pkmode refuses it), so nobody can hide behind it. Town safe
zones (ATTR_BANPK) also still protect, in battle_is_attackable, above all of
this -- "anywhere" in the specification stops at the safe zone, deliberately:
killing inside one would break every shop and vendor standing in it.

The flag is cleared on death and expires on its own after 30 seconds, and there
is no death event to catch either. It is re-armed in UpdateKillerMode, which
the recovery event already calls for every player about every three seconds, so
it comes back within one cycle without a timer of its own -- and it drops away
within one cycle when the player switches to No Risk.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT CHANGES

The core, five hunks, all keyed off one inline helper so that removing the
feature is removing one header and five short blocks:

  game/src/server/game/src/high_risk.h     NEW. IsHighRiskMode() and the three
                                           named constants. Nothing else.
  char_battle.cpp  UpdateKillerMode()      keeps the killer flag lit
  char_battle.cpp  ItemDropPenalty()       forces the Cruel band, and lets the
                                           mode past the level-50 gate
  char_battle.cpp  the experience path     +50%
  item_manager.cpp GetDropPct()            +50%

The data side:

  files/high_risk.quest                    NEW. The flag, the offer at 15, and
                                           the Guardian's menu.
  prepare-context.sh                       stages it into the game context
  game/Dockerfile                          compiles it and lists it in
                                           locale_list, mirroring speed_boost

The core change is INERT without the quest: no quest, no flag, and all five
checks fall through to stock behaviour. Deleting high_risk.quest -- or setting
M2_HIGH_RISK=0 before prepare-context.sh runs -- turns the mode off completely
without touching a line of C++.

WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT AN EDIT

game/src is deleted and re-staged from the porting tree every time
prepare-context.sh runs, so a hand-edited char_battle.cpp is silently reverted
on the next reassembly. Re-run this script after prepare-context.sh -- or run
it against the porting tree itself with --server, so that the staging carries
the change forward.

Idempotent. A second run prints `already patched' for everything it finds done.

    python3 add_high_risk_mode.py
    python3 add_high_risk_mode.py --server /opt/m2port/port40250 --repo ../..

NOTHING IS BUILT OR RESTARTED HERE. The core must be recompiled and the game
image rebuilt for any of it to take effect; the quest is compiled by qc inside
the image build.

HIGH_RISK_QUEST = '''-- =============================================================
-- High Risk -- an optional, permanently switchable free-PvP mode.
--
-- WHAT IT IS
--
-- From level 15 a character may choose High Risk. It is free game
-- after that: anyone may attack and kill it, its own empire
-- included, and nobody is punished for doing so. In exchange it
-- earns 50% more experience and finds 50% more drops, and when it
-- dies it drops items the way a Cruel character does -- out of the
-- bags and off the body, with the stock quantities and the stock
-- protections. No Risk is the ordinary game and is what a
-- character has until it says otherwise. Either choice can be
-- reversed at any time at a Guardian or a City Guard.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE OWNS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
--
-- One quest flag, `high_risk.mode', and the two ways a player sets
-- it: the offer at level 15 and the Guardian's menu. Everything
-- the flag then MEANS is in the game core -- see high_risk.h and
-- the four places that include it. The split is not a compromise:
--
--   * There is no `dead' event in this quest engine, so the
--     drop-on-death rule could not be written here at all. Worse,
--     qc does not check event names, so `when dead' would compile
--     and then never fire.
--   * affect.add() is hard-wired to affect type 1000
--     (AFFECT_QUEST_START_IDX) whatever apply is passed to it, and
--     affect.get_apply_on() can only ask about a type. The
--     server-wide movement-speed quest already owns that type and
--     decides whether to re-apply itself by asking whether type
--     1000 is present; a second quest affect would answer that
--     question wrongly and the movement bonus would stop coming
--     back after death. So the experience and drop bonuses cannot
--     be affects, and the core reads them off this flag instead.
--
-- Deleting this file switches the mode off completely: no
-- character can set the flag again and every check in the core
-- falls through to stock behaviour.
--
-- HOW A PLAYER KNOWS WHICH MODE THEY ARE IN
--
--   * A High Risk character wears the killer flag permanently, so
--     it is drawn the way a player-killer is drawn -- to itself
--     and to everyone around it. That is the core's doing
--     (CHARACTER::UpdateKillerMode); it is named here because it
--     is the main answer to this question.
--   * A line in the chat window at every login, while the mode is
--     on.
--   * A line at every switch, and the Guardian's menu opens by
--     stating the mode the character is in right now.
--
-- WHY THE OFFER RUNS IN A TIMER AND NOT IN THE EVENT ITSELF
--
-- A dialogue opened straight out of a `login' or `levelup' handler
-- races the client's own start-up, and no stock quest in this tree
-- does it -- they all go through a letter the player clicks.
-- Timers are the exception: dragon_lair_weekly and
-- main_quest_lv66 both open dialogues from a player timer. Three
-- seconds after the level-up, or twenty after a login, is late
-- enough that there is a window to draw into.
--
-- WHY THERE ARE TWO FLAGS AND NOT ONE
--
-- `mode' is the choice; `asked' records that the offer has been
-- made. They cannot be one flag, because pc.setqf(name, 0) DELETES
-- the flag and pc.getqf then returns 0 -- so "chose No Risk" and
-- "has never been asked" would be the same value.
